            <h1>SAM: Wrath of the Mainframe</h1>
            <p><strong>High Concept: </strong>Thrown into a virtual world, you must survive the real danger posed by a tyranical artificial intelligence.</p>
            <p><strong>Player Experience Goals: </strong>The goal of this game is to give the player a sense of desperation as they rush around the map collecting food and water while avoiding enemy units that seek to do harm. There is also a bit of exploration to be had as the game world is altered each day.</p>
            <p><strong>Genre: </strong>Survival Simulator / Rogue-Like</p>
            <p><strong>Game play: </strong>The player will have to navigate the environment and gather food and water while avoiding enemy units. Failure to do so will result in death, either by wounds or by deteriorating health. The game cycles between period of day, where full visibility is available, and night, where visibility is limited. At the end of each night the map resets itself, along with all the resources on it. During certain intervals, special items can be found at a drop zone that will have a variety of (mostly) positive benefits on the player. Lesser items can be crafted from resources scattered throughout the map, though they are all single use.</p>
            <p><strong>Prototype Goal: </strong>Taking the skills aquired from the previous digital assignments, this assignment will focus mostly on algorithms used for procedurally generated levels, events, and item drops. The goal of this project is to create a game similar to what is seen on online game libraries. A special event occurs at the end.</p>
            <p><strong>Features:</strong></p>
            <ul class="a">
                <li>Randomly generated environment</li>
                <li>System of needs (health, food, water)</li>
                <li>Day / Night cycle</li>
                <li>Items that improve player stats, such as maximum health</li>
                <li>Crafting system</li>
                <li>Minimalistic art style</li>
                <li>Random events affecting player stats</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Setting/Premise: </strong> The game takes place in the Survival Action Mainframe, a simulation environment run by an artificial intelligence performing experiments on various subjects.</p>
            <p><strong>Story: </strong>The story is centered around XP-142, a human who mysteriously finds himself trapped inside the Survival Action Mainframe by an artificial intelligence against his will. The only means he has of scaping is to survive against starvation, dehydration, and a Boaty McBoatload of drones and turrets, for seven days. That's about it.</p>
            <p><strong>Target Audience: </strong>Our target audience primarily consists of fans of the rogue-like genre.</p>
            <p><strong>Play time: </strong>This game is bounded by a timer to keep track of the day/night cycles, so at minimum it will take about 8 minutes, though dialogue scenes should extend that time assuming the player decides not to skip them.</p>
            <p><strong>Strategies: </strong>Player strategy will change with each day due to the changing game rules, though it will mostly consist of running from, shooting at, and collecting lots of stuff.</p>
            <p><strong>Prototype Assets: </strong>All assets used currently in the game were created from scratch. Deal with it.</p>
            <p><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game: </strong>Literally any rogue-like.</p>
